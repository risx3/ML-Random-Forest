# Random-Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm used in machine learning for classification, regression, and other tasks. It is a combination of multiple decision trees, where each tree is trained on a subset of the data and a random subset of the features.

Random Forest creates a large number of decision trees, each of which is trained on a random subset of the data. Each tree is trained independently, and the final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees. The aggregation can be done by either taking the majority vote (for classification) or the average (for regression).

Random Forest is a powerful algorithm that can handle non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data. It is also robust to noise and outliers in the data. Random Forest can also be used for feature selection, as it can rank the importance of the features based on their contribution to the overall performance of the model.

Random Forest is widely used in many applications, including image classification, text classification, and financial modeling. It is also used in many real-world scenarios where accuracy and interpretability are both important.

One of the main advantages of Random Forest is that it can reduce overfitting compared to a single decision tree. This is because the random selection of features and data subsets ensures that each tree is trained on a different subset of the data, leading to a more generalized model.
